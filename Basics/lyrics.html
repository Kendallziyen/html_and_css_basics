            'Cause we made it, underestimated and always underrated
            Now, we're saying goodbye, waving to the hard times
            Yeah, it's gonna be alright, like the first time
            Met you at your doorstep, remember how it tasted
            Looking into your eyes, baby, you were still high
            Never coming down with your hand in mine

            Oh my, I remember those nights
            Meet you at your uni, cheap drinks, drink 'em all night
            Staying out 'til sunrise
            Share a single bed and tell each other what we dream about
            Things we'd never say to someone else out loud
            We were only kids, just tryna work it out
            Wonder what they'd think if they could see us now

            Yeah, 'cause we made it, underestimated and always underrated
            Now, we're saying goodbye, waving to the hard times
            Knew that we would be alright, from the first time
            Met you at your doorstep, remember how it tasted
            Looking into your eyes, baby, you were still high
            Never coming down with your hand in mine

            Oh God, what I could've become
            Don't know why they put this all on us when we're so young
            Done a pretty good job, dealing with it all when you're here
            Don't need to say no more
            Nothing in the world that I would change it for
            Singing something pop'y on the same four chords
            Used to worry 'bout it, but I don't no more

            Yeah, 'cause we made it, underestimated and always underrated
            Now, we're saying goodbye, waving to the hard times
            Smoke something, drink something, yeah, just like the first time
            Met you at your doorstep, remember how it tasted
            Looking into your eyes, baby, you were still high
            Never coming down with your hand in mine
            With your hand in mine
            (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) No-no, no-no, 'cause we made it
            (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
            (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) Yeah, 'cause we made it
            (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) Never coming down with your hand in mine
